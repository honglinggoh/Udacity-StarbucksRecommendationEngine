## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no additional libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

I was interested to learn more about hotel line of business data which i merely came across before.  Hence I had selected hotel booking demand data set from Kaggle for the purpose of this project.

There are 3 questions that I was looking focusing on around bookings cancellation.

  1. What is the cancellation rate over the years for different hotel categories?
  2. Are we able to predict booking cancellation based on data set provided?  
  3. For those booking at risk for cancellation, what can the hotel do to mitigate the risk?


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

"hotel_bookings.csv" is the data file that I downloaded from Kaggle which consists of City and Resort Hotels (from Europe) booking transactions from year 2015-2017.

Hotel Booking.ipynb notebook is to showcase work related to the above questions.  I separated the notebook to multiple sections of exploratory analysis that lead to answering the questions above.  Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  


## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@hong.ling.goh/random-forest-for-predicting-city-hotel-booking-cancellation-17222fe479b).
